<p>Welcome to my small site! Here you can catch up what I've been up to or what's on my mind.</p>

<h2>Random Thoughts / Updates</h2>

<h3>September 20, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reading up the reviews of the latest RTX 2080 and it seems like it's pretty much the GTX 1080 Ti. Not gambling my PC budget now, especially when my GTX 1070 is still doing just fine!</li>
<li>I regret purchasing a matcha condiment for coffee. It has no match flavor to it.</li>
<li>Not too clear why, but I'm still feeling a bit grumpy. Maybe it's the hunger that's doing it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>September 19, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anger is still around. Why can't people keep things simple?</li>
<li>I like to blame things on "bad luck" when things just don't go my way. I really need to change that.</li>
<li>Feeling super sore at the arms when attempted to do convicts' workout routine.</li>
<li>Felt super angry and it seeped out to a few people, regretting it right now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>September 18, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Watched "Better Call Saul" - loving the build up, but wish the pacing went a smidge faster.</li>
<li>Got iOS 12 running on both my iPhone and iPad - working great!</li>
<li>Ordered a new domain "briansuite.gq" - for this site!</li>
</ul>
